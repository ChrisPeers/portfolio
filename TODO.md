# Things still to do

1. The website hasn't been tested with internet explorer, this will be done and fixed at a later date. 

2. A lot of the elements on the page are not in the exact same spot as netmatters website.

3. The width of some sections do not match the width of other sections, this needs to be amended. 

4. Tidy up the code and add comments in (normally do this along the way).

5. Refactor old code and make it easier to read, and more simple where possible.
